# I noticed a misbehaviour with 3.7.2 regarding cookie storage for raised HTTP response
# That's the case for the HTTPFound redirections
# It seems the cookies are not sent in the response, and therefore, the browser does not store them
# Obviously, sessions do not work then, and Openid Connect auth.py code is broken
